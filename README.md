# PyBer_Analysis
Analyzing ride share data for the fictional company Pyber.

### Overview of the Analysis

What we're doing with this project is to analyze weekly fares for our ride sharing company. The fares will be broken down into three distinct city types, and then visualized in a line chart. By doing this, we can help the company make informed decisions about where to 

### Results

When we compile the results, we end up with this as a summary:

It showes us that the biggest market is urban cities, followed by suburban and then rural. Interestingly enough, the averages go in reverse in terms of the amount of money charged per ride.

As for our weekly breakdown, it looks like this:

Each type of city has its own trends, but there are a few things in common. For each type of city, there is a boom period near the end of Febuary and a dry spell around the beginning of April. 


### Summary

Based on these reaults, I would recommend these three business plans going forward.

1) Increase the amount of advertisement or promotion in rural cities:
   Rural cities have the lowest amount of customers, but the highest average fare. If we can get more customers, there will likely be increased profits.

2) Find a way to attract customers in April:
  All three cities show a drop off in use in the month of April. While the Suburban cities recover, the Urban and Rural cities still feel the effect. Find out what causes the     uptick of April customers in Suburban cities and see if we can apply the same strategy to the other two.

3) Examine what's happening around the third week of Feburary:
  For all three types of cities, some of the highest profits come at around the same time of the year. Do some digging to see why that is. If it's something we can control,     like a promotion, try running it during times where usage is down. If it's based around something like a holiday, say Valentine's Day given the time of year, try to           capitalize even more on that time period.
